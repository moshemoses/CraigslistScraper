Stickley vintage solid wood desk,2019-04-11 01:12,(Rutherford),"Stickley vintage solid wood desk dating from the 50s or 60s. Has chips on the two lower left drawers. The lower right drawer gets jammed in humid weather. Otherwise in good condition with normal wear and tear for a piece of this age. You must arrange pickup and transportation. This desk is very heavy due to being solid wood, likely over 100 pounds, and requires at least two strong people to carry. We live on the third floor. There is an elevator to the first floor which it may fit in, but there is also a short flight of stairs in the lobby. Clean and smoke-free home. Serious inquiries only.",https://newjersey.craigslist.org/zip/d/rutherford-stickley-vintage-solid-wood/6863462541.html
